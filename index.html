    <h1>VitaPaw Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 23, 2025</p>

    <p>VitaPaw ("we", "our", "us") is an AI-powered pet meal personalization app. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use the VitaPaw mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

    <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly, as well as certain information generated by your use of the App, to deliver meal personalization, manage subscriptions, and coordinate delivery.</p>

    <h3>A. User Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>At Sign-Up:</strong> name, email address, password, city, date of birth, and profile image.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile Updates:</strong> you may edit your user information within the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Pet Data (for AI meal personalization)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pet name, breed, date of birth, weight, gender.</li>
      <li>Activity level, body condition, health goals.</li>
      <li>Allergies, favorite foods, health conditions, medical records, poop status/condition, neutered status.</li>
      <li>Other characteristics you add to improve personalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Subscription, Inventory, and Delivery Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subscription Details:</strong> chosen meals, meal edits/regenerations, plan type, frequency, status.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Information:</strong> delivery addresses and contact details for order dispatch/midway status/delivered status.</li>
      <li><strong>Admin & Operations:</strong> admin role assignment, ingredient/inventory updates, order preparation stage (preparing/ready), approvals and internal notes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Device & Usage Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type, operating system, app version, and crash/diagnostic logs.</li>
      <li>In-app actions related to meal generation, subscription management, and delivery tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Personalization:</strong> to generate, edit, and improve pet meals using your pet data and current inventory data.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> to process new subscriptions, admin approvals, modifications, pauses, and cancellations.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Operations:</strong> to coordinate dispatch, midpoint updates, and confirmation of delivery.</li>
      <li><strong>App Improvements:</strong> to monitor performance, fix bugs, and enhance features.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> to send important updates about subscriptions, deliveries, or policy changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) AI Processing (Gemini)</h2>
    <p>To generate pet meals, the App uses an AI model (Gemini). The AI processes a combination of <em>pet data you provide</em> and <em>available ingredient inventory</em> configured by admins to propose meal formulations. We apply data-minimization by sending only the fields needed for the requested task. The AI output is used within VitaPaw to assist you in selecting, editing, or regenerating meals.</p>

    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Where applicable, AI processing may be performed by our cloud providers under their privacy and security terms, acting as service providers/processors on our behalf.
    </div>

    <h2>4) Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share information only as described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Authentication, database, hosting, AI processing, analytics/crash reporting, and delivery/logistics partners that help us operate the App (e.g., Firebase/Firestore Authentication & database, crash reporting, cloud/AI infrastructure, delivery partners). These providers process data under contractual safeguards.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal & Safety:</strong> If required by law, legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of VitaPaw, our users, or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data in transit is protected via HTTPS/TLS.</li>
      <li>Authentication is handled via secure methods (e.g., Firebase Authentication).</li>
      <li>Personal and pet data are stored with industry-standard protections in managed cloud databases.</li>
      <li>Access controls are applied to admin functionality and operational data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Permissions & Consent</h2>
    <p>The App may request the following permissions. You can grant or revoke them via your device settings.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> used to support delivery (e.g., determining delivery to your current or saved address). Depending on your OS settings, this may include approximate or precise location. The App does not continuously track your location in the background unless you explicitly enable such a feature.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> used to send subscription status updates (e.g., admin approval), meal preparation stages (preparing/ready), and delivery updates (dispatched/midway/delivered) to users; and relevant operational alerts to admins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with the services. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time by following the steps below:</p>
    <p><strong>Delete Account:</strong> To delete your account and all associated data, please visit the following link: <a href="https://vitapaw.app/delete-account">Delete Your Account</a>. All personal data associated with your account will be permanently deleted within 7 business days.</p>

    <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>9) Your Rights</h2>

    <h2>10) International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Our service providers may process data in countries other than your own. Where applicable, we implement safeguards to protect your information consistent with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you within the App or by email. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
